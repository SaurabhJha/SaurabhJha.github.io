*In this article, we cover concepts from the [second lesson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2020fa/lesson/2/) of the [advanced compilers course](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2020fa/self-guided/) from Cornell. However, the specific algorithms discussed in this article are different from the ones discussed in the course.*

## Introduction
To execute a program written in a high level-language, we first need to translate it into a processor-specific machine language program. One way to do
this is to first translate the program text into a data structure. We can then use that data structure to generate a machine language program. These
intermediary data structures are called intermediate representations.

These intermediate representation languages are closer to assembly languages than the source languages. They have more primitive operators and more
primitive control flow facilities. The intermediate representations are effectively abstracted assembly languages that do not have various architecture
quirks.

A benefit of this design is that we can translate multiple source languages into an intermediate representation. That intermediate representation can then
generate different processor-specific programs. It is easier to write new languages for existing architectures and for an existing compiler to target new
architectures.

Another benefit of this design is that the analyses and transformations done on intermediate representations remain intact when we generate machine code from
that intermediate representation. It's a consequence of intermediate representations being a good model of the processor specific languages.

Some examples of intermediate representations are [Llvm IR](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) and [Java bytecode](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html).

In this article, we will study a method of grouping instructions written in an intermediate language. These instruction groups are called *basic blocks*.
We will start by describing the relevant parts of the IR language that we will be using. After that, we will represent our program using a data structure
called the *control flow graph*. And finally, we will use the control flow graph representation to construct basic blocks.

## Relevant intermediate representation (IR) background
We will be using [Bril](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/bril/) intermediate representation which came out of the [Capra](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/) group
at [Cornell](https://www.cornell.edu/). We will restrict ourselves to the following features of Bril.

1. Bril programs have a textual representation and a json representation. These representations are interchangeble.
2. The Bril programs under consideration will have only one function named `main`.
3. Labels mark specific points in a program. They are used to refer to instructions by other instructions of a program.
4. An instruction can be either a label or an operation.
5. There are two control flow instructions: `jmp` and `br`.
6. The `jmp` is an unconditional jump that takes one argument, the label to jump to.
7. The `br` is a conditional jump that takes three arguments. It takes a variable of type bool and two labels. The program jumps to the first label
   if the variable is true and the second label otherwise.

More details about bril can be found in the [documentation](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/bril/).

Here are some examples. Below is a simple program that prints a constant.

```
@main {
  v: int = const 4;
  print v;
}
```

Its json representation is this.

```json
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "instrs": [
        {"dest": "v", "type": "int", "op": "const", "value": 4},
        {"op": "print", "args": ["v"]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Here's a program that uses the `jmp` instruction to do an unconditional jump to a label.

```
@main {
  v: int = const 4;
  jmp .somewhere;
  v: int = const 2;
.somewhere:
  print v;
}
```

Its json representation is this.

```json
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "instrs": [
        {"dest": "v", "type": "int", "op": "const", "value": 4},
        {"op": "jmp", "labels": ["somewhere"]},
        {"dest": "v", "type": "int", "op": "const", "value": 2},
        {"label": "somewhere"},
        {"op": "print", "args": ["v"]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

And here's a program that uses `br` to do a conditional jump.

```
@main {
  v: int = const 4;
  b: bool = const false;
  br b .there .here;
.here:
  v: int = const 2;
.there:
  print v;
}
```

Here, the value of `b` determines whether the jump is going to `here` or `there`. Since the value of `b` is hardcoded to `false` in this example, it will
always jump to the `.here` label. The json representation looks like this.

```json
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "instrs": [
        {"dest": "v", "type": "int", "op": "const", "value": 4},
        {"dest": "b", "type": "bool", "op": "const", "value": false},
        {"op": "br", "args": ["b"], "labels": ["there", "here"]},
        {"label": "here"},
        {"dest": "v", "type": "int", "op": "const", "value": 2},
        {"label": "there"},
        {"op": "print", "args": ["v"]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Control flow graph
A control flow graph represents the flow of control of a function. Each instruction is a vertex in the graph and the vertices are connected
according to the flow of control of instructions.

For example, for the program

```
@main {
  v: int = const 4;
  print v;
}
```

the control flow graph will looks like this.

<img src="{{site.url}}/static/img/compilers/basic_blocks/simple_cfg.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" />

For the program

```
@main {
  v: int = const 4;
  jmp .somewhere;
  v: int = const 2;
.somewhere:
  print v;
}
```

it will look like this.

<img src="{{site.url}}/static/img/compilers/basic_blocks/jmp_cfg.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" />

To construct the control flow graph for a program, we need to compute the instructions that we can directly go to from each instruction. In our intermediate
representation, the answers are as follows.

1. If the instruction is neither a `jmp` nor a `br`, the reachable instruction is the next instruction in the instruction array.
2. If the instruction is a `jmp`, the next instruction is the instruction identified by the label of the jump.
3. If the instruction is a `br`, there are two instructions reachable from that instruction, identified by the labels of the instruction.

Points 2. and 3. refer to labels. To construct the control flow graph, we first need to associate labels with their corresponding instructions. Let's clarify
this with an example. Here's the json representation of our `jmp` program.


```json
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "instrs": [
        {"dest": "v", "type": "int", "op": "const", "value": 4},
        {"op": "jmp", "labels": ["somewhere"]},
        {"dest": "v", "type": "int", "op": "const", "value": 2},
        {"label": "somewhere"},
        {"op": "print", "args": ["v"]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In Bril, an instruction is a label if it has the `label` property. There is only one such instruction in this program, `{"label": "somewhere"}`,
which is the second last instruction.

Before constructing the control flow graph, we need to map labels to indices of instructions in the instruction array. Here is a python implementation of this
idea which takes the `instrs` list from the json representation as input.

```python
def map_labels_to_instructions(instrs):
    label_to_instruction = {}
    for idx, instr in enumerate(self.instrs):
        if "label" in instr:  # is the instruction a label?
            label_to_instruction[instr["label"]] = idx

    return label_to_instruction
```

Let's do an example run of the above program. For the `br` program reproduced below,


```json
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "instrs": [
        {"dest": "v", "type": "int", "op": "const", "value": 4},
        {"dest": "b", "type": "bool", "op": "const", "value": false},
        {"op": "br", "args": ["b"], "labels": ["there", "here"]},
        {"label": "here"},
        {"dest": "v", "type": "int", "op": "const", "value": 2},
        {"label": "there"},
        {"op": "print", "args": ["v"]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

the output would be the following dictionary.

```python
{
    "here": 3,
    "there": 5
}
```

We are ready to construct the control flow graph of a program. We will represent this graph using adjacency list representation.
For each instruction, we need to figure out the instructions it can go to. 

```python
def construct_graph(instrs):
    label_to_instruction = map_labels_to_instructions(instrs)
    graph = collections.defaultdict(set)  # Adjacency list representation of program

    for idx, instr in enumerate(self.instrs):
        if "op" in instr and instr["op"] in {"jmp", "br"}:
            # It is a jmp or a br. Find destination instruction indexes corresponding to labels and connect
            # them to this instruction index.
            for label in instr["labels"]:
                dest_instr_idx = label_to_instruction[label]
                graph[idx].add(dest_instr_idx)
        elif idx < len(self.instrs) - 1:
            # Its not the last instruction. Connect it to the subsequent instruction.
            graph[idx].add(idx + 1)
    return graph
```
This program is identifying each instruction with its array index. For our above `br` program, it will construct this dictionary.

```python
{
    0: {1},
    1: {2},
    2: {3, 5},
    3: {4},
    4: {5},
    5: {6},
}
```

Pictorially, it will look like this. We have labelled vertices here with instruction numbers and their corresponding instructions.

<img src="{{site.url}}/static/img/compilers/basic_blocks/br_cfg.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" />

## Basic blocks
We now have all the concepts we need to discuss basic blocks. A basic block is a sequence of instructions such that:

1. Executing its first instruction guarantees that all instructions within that block will execute.
2. We can enter a block via the first instruction only. There is no other entry point for a basic block.

Let's construct basic blocks for the following program.

```
@main {
  v: int = const 4;
  b: bool = const false;
  br b .there .here;
.here:
  v: int = const 2;
.there:
  print v;
  jmp .here;
}
```

Starting from the first instruction, we can see that if `v: int = const 4;` executes, then `b: bool = const false;` will definitely execute. And if
`b: bool = const false;` executes, then `br b .there .here` will definitely execute.

It could happen that `.here` executes after `br b .there .here`. But `.here` will also execute after the last instruction `jmp .here`. According to the
second point of our definition, we can only enter a basic block via its first instruction. Thus, we must finish our current block at `br b .there .here` and start a new
one at `.here`.

If `.here` executes, then `v: int = const 2` will definitely execute. And while its true that the execution of `v: inst = const 2` implies the execution
of `.there`, it is also true that `.there` could follow `br b .there .here`. Thus, `v: int = const 2` should end the current block and `.there` should
start a new block.

Similarly, the block starting from `.there` ends at `jmp .here`.

The below figure shows the control flow graph of the above program with the basic blocks marked by gray boxes.

<img src="{{site.url}}/static/img/compilers/basic_blocks/br2_cfg_dotted.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" />

Let's convert our above intuition into an algorithm and its implementation. Since we are modeling our list of instructions as graphs, we should translate
the requirements of basic blocks into graphical terms. We can re-express the two criteria like this.

1. Each vertex in a block except the last one has one outgoing edge. The last vertex can have either no outgoing edge or multiple outgoing edges.
2. Each vertex in a block except the first has one incoming edge. The first vertex can have either no incoming edge or multiple incoming edges.

We can check the first requirement for each vertex by doing a depth-first search on the graph. To check the second requirement, we need to compute the
parent vertices for each vertex. We can determine the parent vertices for each vertex by doing a breadth-first search on our control flow graph. The
python implementation is as follows.

```python
def construct_child_parent_relationship(graph):
    child_to_parent = collections.defaultdict(set)  # Each vertex can have multiple parents.
    queue = collections.deque()
    unvisited = {idx for idx in range(1, len(self.instrs))}
    
    queue.append(0)  # Start from the first vertex.
    while queue:
        # Main BFS loop.
        current_vertex = queue.popleft()
        for next_vertex in self.graph[current_vertex]:
            # Whether or not we have seen next_vertex before, add current_vertex as its parent.
            child_to_parent[next_vertex].add(current_vertex)
            if next_vertex in unvisited:
                unvisited.remove(next_vertex)
                queue.append(next_vertex)

        if not queue and unvisited:
            # If the queue is empty but there are still some unvisited vertices, pop a random
            # unvisited vertex into the queue.
            queue.append(unvisited.pop())

    return child_to_parent
```

We are now ready to group vertices into basic blocks. We start with the first instruction and keep constructing new basic blocks till we have exhausted all the instructions. We do this using a depth-first search. Because we have several state variables related to basic blocks, it would be easier to do it using an iterative depth-first search. Here is an implementation of our two requirements. Because the code is relatively more involved, we run it on one of our example programs right after the code.

{% highlight python linenos %}
def construct_basic_blocks(instrs):
    child_to_parent = self.construct_child_parent_relationship()
    stack = [0]
    basic_blocks = []
    current_block = []
    unvisited = {idx for idx in range(1, len(self.instrs))}
    while stack:
        current_vertex = stack.pop()
        if not current_block or len(child_to_parent[current_vertex]) == 1:
            current_block.append(current_vertex)
        else:
            basic_blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = [current_vertex]

        if len(self.graph[current_vertex]) != 1:
            # If the current vertex has either zero children or more than one children, it must terminate
            # the current block and we must start a new block. Multiple edges cannot come out from within
            # a block.
            basic_blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = []

        unvisited_children = {vertex for vertex in self.graph[current_vertex] if vertex in unvisited}
        if not unvisited_children:
            # No child for the current vertex. End current block and start a new block.
            basic_blocks.append(current_block)
            current_block = []
        else:
            # Continue dfs on unseen children.
            for next_vertex in unvisited_children:
                unvisited.remove(next_vertex)
                stack.append(next_vertex)
            
        if not stack and unvisited:
            # If the stack is empty but there are some unprocessed vertices, add them to the stack.
            stack.append(unvisited.pop())

    basic_blocks = [current_block for current_block in basic_blocks if current_block]
    basic_blocks.sort()
    return basic_blocks
{% endhighlight %}

Let's run this code on the below program. To make it easy to read, we converted the `instrs` array into an object with indices. It will help in
relating instructions to their indices.

```json
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "instrs": {
        0: {"dest": "v", "type": "int", "op": "const", "value": 4},
        1: {"dest": "b", "type": "bool", "op": "const", "value": false},
        2: {"op": "br", "args": ["b"], "labels": ["there", "here"]},
        3: {"label": "here"},
        4: {"dest": "v", "type": "int", "op": "const", "value": 2},
        5: {"label": "there"},
        6: {"args": ["v"], "op": "print"},
        7: {"labels": ["here"], "op": "jmp"}
      },
    }
  ]
}
```

The control flow graph and the child to parent relationships for the above program looks like this.

```python
control_flow_graph = {0: {1}, 1: {2}, 2: {3, 5}, 3: {4}, 4: {5}, 5: {6}, 6: {7}, 7: {3}}
child_parent_dict = {1: {0}, 2: {1}, 3: {2, 7}, 5: {2, 4}, 4: {3}, 6: {5}, 7: {6}}
```

We are now ready to simulate our `construct_basic_blocks` function. Here are the four variables that we will track along with their initial values.

```python
basic_blocks = []
current_block = []
stack = [0]
unvisited = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
```

We enter the `while` loop of line 7 for the first time. Because the `current_block` is empty, the `if` block of line 9 will execute. Since there is only
one child of `1`, the `if` block of line 15 won't execute. And since there is an unvisited child of vertex `0`, the `else` block of line 27 will execute.
The `if` block of line 33 will not execute. The situation looks like this now.

```python
basic_blocks = []
current_block = [0]
stack = [1]
unvisited = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
```

Entering the `while` loop again, the `if` block on line 9 will execute because `1` has only one parent. And since `1` has one unvisited child,
the `if` block of line 15 won't execute and the `else` block of line 27 will execute. The `if` block of line 33 will again be skipped. After second
iteration, the variables look like this.

```python
basic_blocks = []
current_block = [0, 1]
stack = [2]
unvisited = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
```

The next iteration of the `while` loop will be different. The current vertex `2` has just one parent so it will be added
to the current block. But vertex `2` has two children so we will end the current block in the `if` block of line 15 and start a new block. Since the children
of `2` are in `unvisited`, we add them to the stack in the `else` block of line 27.

```python
basic_blocks = [[0, 1, 2]]
current_block = []
stack = [3, 5]
unvisited = {4, 6, 7}
```

Now `5` will be our current vertex. Because `5` has two parents, `2` and `4`, the current block ends and a new block is initalised with `5` in the `else` block of line 11. Since `5` has an unvisited child, the `else` block of line 27 will execute. The `if` block of line 33 will not execute.

```python
basic_blocks = [[0, 1, 2]]
current_block = [5]
stack = [3, 6]
unvisited = {4, 7}
```

Now the current vertex is `6` which has one parent and one unvisited child so the state variables look like this.

```python
basic_blocks = [[0, 1, 2]]
current_block = [5, 6]
stack = [3, 7]
unvisited = {4}
```

The current vertex is `7` which has one parent but has no unvisited child. We therefore end the current block and start a new one. The variables
look like this now.

```python
basic_blocks = [[0, 1, 2], [5, 6, 7]]
current_block = []
stack = [3]
unvisited = {4}
```

The current block is empty so we initialise a new block in the `if` of line 9 with `3`. `3` has one unvisited children which we add to the stack.

```python
basic_blocks = [[0, 1, 2], [5, 6, 7]]
current_block = [3]
stack = [4]
unvisited = {}
```

Now, the vertex `4` has just one parent and no unvisited child. The stack would be empty now and there are no unvisited vertices left.
`4` will be added to the current block in the `if` block of line 9. There are no unvisited vertices left so the current block will be appended to
the list of basic blocks in the `if` block of line 23. There will no more iterations of the while loop.

```python
basic_blocks = [[0, 1, 2], [5, 6, 7], [3, 4]]
current_block = []
stack = []
unvisited = {}
```

After the loop, we remove empty blocks and sort basic blocks. Sorting helps in recombining basic blocks to form a complete list of instructions. The final
result will look like this.

```python
basic_blocks = [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]
```

The basic blocks we computed using this function match the ones we computed intutively using graph above.

## Conclusion
Breaking a list of instructions into basic blocks is the first step towards compiler optimizations. In a next article, we will discuss optimizations
that we can do within a basic block.
